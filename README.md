# Sales-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

Here we have build a model for sales prediction of the marketing dataset  
Following are the steps included while performing linear regression  
1. Import dependencies
2. Perform EDA and preprocessing which include  
   -> Handling the missing values  
   -> Handling the outliers  
   -> Checking the skewness of the data and handling it with squareroot transformation or log transformation  
3. Split the data into train and test  
4. Training the model using Linear Reagression
5. Calculating the errors, R-Square, Root mean squared error(RMSE)

Here in this model we have achieved an accuracy of 90.1%.
